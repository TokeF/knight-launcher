# Knight Launcher

Knight Launcher is a work-in-progress web-based mini-game where you launch a knight from a ballista across a battlefield into a castle wall. The purpose is simply to try out "vibe" coding.

I am mainting a prompts.txt log to track all prompts used so far.

## Features

- **Physics-based Gameplay**: Launch the knight and watch as it bounces, slides, and interacts with the environment.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Encounter tents, mud pits, and enemy knights dynamically spawned across the battlefield.
- **Shop System**: Spend coins earned from your score to purchase upgrades and items like the "Smash Shield."

## Tech Stack and Tools

- **WindSurf**: IDE (using a free trial)
- **LLModels**: Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT 4.1
- **Phaser 3**: A fast and flexible 2D game framework for building the game.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and maintainable code.
- **Vite**: A modern build tool for fast development and optimized builds.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the basic structure and styling of the game container.
- **LocalStorage**: Used to persist high scores, coins, and purchased items.

## Project Status

This project is a work in progress and is intended as a vibe-coding project. It is being developed iteratively, with features and ideas being refined and added over time.
It is currently not hosted, but can be run locally.
I will add some thoughts about vibe coding later.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. Open the game in your browser at the provided local development URL.
