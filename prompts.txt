Initial Prompt:

I want to create a new web based minigame. It should be a laucher game where a knight is launced from a ballista across a battlefield into a castle wall. Spar with me to refine the project plan, implementation and ideas for the game.

---

Physics Prompt (2025-07-07T16:19:07+02:00):

let us work a little more on the physics. The knight should bounce like a ball anytime it hits the ground. The bounce should be proportional to the kinetic energy of the knight. The kinetic energy should decrease everytime the ground is hit, until it becomes 0 and the knight will be still.

---

Scoring and Reset Prompt (2025-07-07T16:32:06+02:00):

- Add a score showing the distance the knight has travelled. 
- when the knight has zero velocity, a title should show stating "Press space bar to reset", pressing spacebar should reset the game.

---

Reset Bug Report (2025-07-07T16:36:56+02:00):

The reset is not working properly. When the game resets, the trajectory line is not there and it is not possible to launch the knight

---

Reset Bug Report 2 (2025-07-07T16:40:27+02:00):

Almost working, but reset drops the knight, and then displays reset text. I suggest we keep a bool isLaunched that changes when the knight is launched, we should only reset once velocity is 0 AND isLaunched

---

Reset Bug Report 3 (2025-07-07T16:45:00+02:00):

The reset is still not working. The keypress from the reset action is carrying over and causing an immediate, zero-power launch in the new scene.

---

Camera Follow Prompt (2025-07-07T16:52:23+02:00):

make the camera follow the knights flight

---

Black Screen Bug (2025-07-07T16:54:40+02:00):

as soon as knight is launched, screen turns black and has none of the objects

---

Disappearing Elements Bug (2025-07-07T16:57:24+02:00):

all elements on the screen still disappear when the knight is launched.

---

Manual Tent Bounce Prompt (2025-07-07T19:58:06+02:00):

the tents restitution does not affect the bounce of the knight. I think we should handle it in the else if    } else if (otherLabel === "tent") {
        // The bounce is now handled by the tent's restitution property
      }

---

Tent Bounce Bug (2025-07-07T20:06:59+02:00):

take a look at the tent bounce again, no extra force or bounce seems to be applied to the knight when it hits the tent

---

Tent Bounce Bug 2 (2025-07-07T20:11:21+02:00):

great, the tent else if is executed, but no bounce is happening, this is the log:
Knight collided with: tent GameScene.ts:156:15
Applying bounce force from tent!

The documentation for applyforce is here:
https://brm.io/matter-js/docs/classes/Body.html

---

Pixel Art Request (Knight Only) (2025-07-07T20:29:49+02:00):

Generate a pixel art sprite for the knight character, and use it instead of the rectangle

---

Manual Ground Bounce (2025-07-08T09:03:10+02:00):

instead of using restitution for knight bounce, use setVelocity when collision with ground, similar to how tent and mud collission is hanfled

---

High Score Request (2025-07-08T09:09:41+02:00):

In top right corner, add a high score, similar to the score text. It should dispolay the furthest the knight has travelled in any launch so far.

---

Enemy Knights Request (2025-07-08T09:21:43+02:00):

---

Refactoring Request (2025-07-08T13:51:53+02:00):

refactor and isolate logic and components to follow separation of concerns priciple, making the code more readable, maintanable and easier to extend

I want to add enemy knights walking around at random on the ground. To begin with they can just be square boxes. They should walk some set distance, then randomly continue or turn around for a new distance. The step distance should be between 100 and 300 pixels.
When the player knight collides with enemy knights, increase player velocity.
- add 20 knights to begin with.
- they should walk at a medium speed
- x and y velocity should be multiplied by 1.2 (user said 1, interpreted as a boost)
- to begin with, lets spawn enemies across entire game world

---

Refactor and Bugfix Request (2025-07-08T09:30:03+02:00):

1. Refactor collision handling to use a single if/else if chain.
2. Fix floating enemy knights; they should be locked to the ground and only move horizontally.

---

Enemy Interaction and Removal (2025-07-08T09:37:26+02:00):

1. When an enemy knight is hit, remove it after the bounce effect is applied.
2. Enemy knights should not interact with anything in the world, including gravity, except the player knight.

---

Enemy Movement Timing (2025-07-08T09:54:12+02:00):

enemy knights should start moving as soon as the scene is loaded. They should not wait for player to be launched

---

Dynamic Object Loading (2025-07-08T10:11:33+02:00):

To keep performance, I think we should update objects in the world dynamically, in a sliding window fashion. I suggest that we dynamically add objects as the player aproaches, and delete objects behind the player.

---

Seeded Dynamic Obstacles (2025-07-08T10:26:41+02:00):

add 10 tents and 5 mudpits to the game. They should also be spawned dynamically similar to enemies. 
Everytime the world resets we should have random seed value, the tent and mud x coordinate should depend on the seed value, such that they are spawned differently with each reset. Distance between obstacles should never be less than 50 pixels

---

Refactor Bugs (2025-07-08T14:46:15+02:00):

after the refactor, the reset functionality is not working
furthermore, the player sprite is gone

---

Reset Functionality Broken (2025-07-08T14:49:49+02:00):

reset functionalitys i not working. WHen the player has stopped, spacebar does not reset, and no text is displayed

---

Simplify Reset Logic (2025-07-08T15:15:41+02:00):

instead of using timeout and cancheckstop, can we just base the check on isKnightLaunched and isKnightStopped

---

Main Menu Request (2025-07-08T16:04:33+02:00):

let us create a main page, it shoudl have two buttons. Play and Shop.
the Play button should start the game and take us to the screen as it currently is.
The shop button should just log to concole "shop pressed" for now.

---

Shop Screen Request (2025-07-08T16:12:17+02:00):

Alright now create a shop screen. When pressing the shop button open the shop screen. The shop should contain a list view of items. In the first column should be an image of the item, just add a placeholder for now. Second column should list which stats the item modifies e.g. speed, bounce, friction. Third column should contain a description of the item.
Add 5 placeholder items.

---

Ground Collision Bug Fix (2025-07-08T17:10:21+02:00):

User identified that the static ground body lacked a `gameObject` property, causing the collision check to fail. User fixed this by changing the check in `CollisionManager.ts` to `!otherBody` and added a guard to only handle ground collisions after the knight is launched.

---

Coin System Request (2025-07-08T18:30:43+02:00):

now lets add a coin system. the coins can be used to purchase items in the shop. Every score point is worth one coin, so with every reset, add the score as coins to the players wallet. The total amount of coins in the wallet should be displayed inside the shop

---

High Score and UI Update Request (2025-07-08T18:38:12+02:00):

- in the shop, the amount of coins should be displayed in the top right corner.
- we should also store the highscore in localStorage and update it whenever we beat it

---

High Score Bug Report (2025-07-08T18:41:33+02:00):

there is an issue. The highscore is persisted during page refresh, however, when the player is launched it is set to 0. Instead we should load the highscore from local storage and only update it when current score becomes greater than highscore. If there is no highscore in localstorage, initialize it to 0.
